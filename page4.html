      This is an outline for a long term project I want to make for fun. It would be a historical fiction of a Biblical narrative of David.
      Long story short- he had a crazy life which I thought would make for a beautiful narrative. Courage, dedication, friendship,
      loss, responsibility, failure, repentance, betrayal, and reconciliation. It's a touching story arch that I thought could be a
      wholistic narrative- and a good game. The game would be a 2D rpg with a focus on story telling.

          Chapter 1: A Shepherd Boy
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
          [The game opens with a cinematic sequence where Samuel, an aged prophet, narrates the story of David,
          setting the stage for the player.]
        </p>
        <p class='indent' , style="margin-left: 75px;">
          In the vast expanse of eternity, from the dawning of creation to the very core of existence,
          the tapestry of human history unfolds in a symphony of triumph and tragedy. Across the annals of time,
          from the humble beginnings of mankind in the garden, to this very day, one truth remains constant: the fragility
          of the human spirit, the inevitability of our fallibility.
        </p>
        <p class='indent' , style="margin-left: 75px;">

          Throughout all of time, from the dawn of creation to the present moment, humanity has grappled with the dual
          nature of our existence. We are beings of light and darkness, capable of both boundless compassion and unfathomable
          cruelty. In the grand epic of life, we dance upon the stage of destiny, each of us playing our part in the
          unfolding story that is our life.
        </p>
        <p class='indent' , style="margin-left: 75px;">

          Yet, in our moments of weakness and folly, in the depths of despair and doubt, there shines a beacon of hope—a divine
          thread woven into the fabric of our being. For even amidst the chaos and confusion of mortal existence, there exists a
          plan— a grand design.
        </p>
        <p class='indent' , style="margin-left: 75px;">

          In the end, it is not the greatness of our deeds or the magnitude of our failures that define us but rather the courage to rise
          above our limitations, to embrace our destiny with open arms, and to walk boldly into the unknown, guided by faith and fueled by
          hope. For in the end, it is not the journey itself that matters but rather the lessons we learn along the way, the bonds we forge,
          and the legacy we leave behind.

        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
          [As Samuel's voice fades, the scene transitions seamlessly into gameplay, with the player taking control of David amidst the lush
          landscapes of ancient Israel. The camera zooms in on David as he confronts a fierce lion in the wilderness.]
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
          [The player engages in turn-based combat, strategically selecting David's actions and abilities to outmaneuver
          the lion. Each move requires careful consideration, as David's health and stamina are finite resources. The battle
          system is designed to be intuitive yet challenging, rewarding players for tactical thinking and mastery of their
          character's skills.]
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">

          [After a thrilling battle, David emerges victorious, showcasing his bravery and prowess in combat with a sling. The lion's defeated
          roar echoes across the landscape as David catches his breath, the adrenaline still coursing through his veins.]
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
          [As David explores the surrounding area, the player discovers hidden treasures, encounters other wildlife, and interacts
          with NPCs who offer quests and challenges. The environment is teeming with life, from lush forests to babbling brooks,
          inviting players to immerse themselves in the richly detailed world.]
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
          [Suddenly, one of David's brothers rushes up to him, breathless and urgent. David returns home to find Samuel waiting for
          him, a solemn expression on his face. With a sense of reverence, Samuel anoints David with a horn of oil, proclaiming him
          as the chosen one, destined to be the future king of Israel. The moment is both awe-inspiring and surreal, as if time itself
          has paused to mark this significant event.]
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
          [Despite the weight of his destiny, David continues to live his normal life, engaging in quests and sidequests that range from
          mundane tasks to epic adventures. The player can explore the bustling marketplace, barter with merchants for rare items, and
          participate in friendly competitions with fellow villagers.]
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
          [As time passes in the game, the player experiences pivotal moments in David's life, such as conversations with his father Jesse
          and his brothers. These interactions provide insight into David's relationships and the dynamics within his family, adding depth
          to the narrative.]
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left: 75px;">
          [When night falls, the player can choose to have David retire to his humble abode, signaling the end of the day and allowing the
          plot to progress to the next chapter. With its blend of immersive gameplay, strategic combat, and rich storytelling, the first
          chapter of the game sets the stage for an epic adventure that will captivate players for hours on end.]
