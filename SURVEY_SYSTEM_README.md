# üéÆ Enhanced Survey Change Management System

This system provides a comprehensive solution for managing survey changes with image previews, approval/denial functionality, and automatic code updates.

## üåü Features

### Enhanced Email Reports
- **Visual Email Reports**: Each email includes actual images of the survey items
- **Interactive Buttons**: Approve or deny buttons for each change directly in the email
- **Rich HTML Format**: Professional email layout with proper styling
- **Text Fallback**: Plain text version for compatibility

### Smart Change Management
- **Approval System**: Click "Approve" to automatically update the survey.html file
- **Denial System**: Click "Deny" to permanently reject changes (never asked again)
- **Auto-Population Integration**: Only changed auto-populated content is included
- **Change Tracking**: Tracks what was modified vs. what was originally auto-populated

### Web Management Interface
- **Change Management Dashboard**: View all pending and denied changes
- **Visual Interface**: See images alongside proposed changes
- **Statistics**: Track approval/denial rates and activity
- **Real-time Updates**: Refresh data to see latest changes

## üìÅ System Files

```
/pages/survey.html        - Main survey page with enhanced functionality
/api/survey-api.php       - Backend API for processing changes
/change-management.html   - Web interface for managing changes (optional, not included here)
/api/pending_changes.json - Stores pending changes awaiting approval
/api/denied_changes.json  - Stores permanently denied changes
```

## üîß How It Works

### 1. Survey Submission Process
1. User fills out survey with ratings and name/description changes
2. System detects what was modified from auto-populated content
3. Changes are submitted to the API and stored in `pending_changes.json`
4. Enhanced HTML email is generated with images and action buttons

### 2. Email Review Process
1. You receive an HTML email with visual previews of each changed item
2. Each item shows the image, proposed changes, and action buttons
3. Click "‚úÖ Approve & Apply Changes" to update the survey code
4. Click "‚ùå Deny (Never Ask Again)" to permanently reject

### 3. Automatic Code Updates
When you approve a change:
1. The system automatically updates `pages/survey.html`
2. New descriptions are added to the `descriptionsDatabase`
3. Future survey users will see the updated auto-populated content
4. The change is removed from pending list

### 4. Denial System
When you deny a change:
1. The change is moved to the denied list
2. Future identical submissions are automatically blocked
3. Users won't be able to submit the same change again

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Setup Requirements
1. **Web Server**: Requires PHP for the API functionality (e.g., `php -S 0.0.0.0:8080`)
2. **File Permissions**: API needs write access to survey.html and JSON files
3. **Email Client**: HTML email support recommended for best experience

### Initial Setup
1. Upload all files to your web server
2. Ensure PHP is enabled and files have proper permissions
3. Test by submitting a survey change
4. Check the change management interface at `/change-management.html`

### Using the System
1. **Survey Users**: Fill out the survey normally - system handles the rest
2. **Administrators**: Monitor changes via email or web interface
3. **Quick Approval**: Use email buttons for fast approval/denial
4. **Bulk Management**: Use web interface for detailed review

## üìä Management Interface

Access the change management system at (if implemented):
```
https://yoursite.com/change-management.html
```

### Dashboard Features
- **Pending Changes Tab**: Review and process new submissions
- **Denied Changes Tab**: View permanently rejected changes  
- **Statistics Tab**: Monitor system usage and activity
- **Refresh Button**: Update data in real-time

### Processing Changes
1. **View Details**: See image, current description, and proposed changes
2. **Approve**: Instantly updates the survey code and database
3. **Deny**: Permanently blocks similar future submissions
4. **Track Results**: Monitor approval/denial statistics

## üîí Security Features

### Change Validation
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Identical changes are blocked if previously denied
- **Input Sanitization**: All user input is properly escaped
- **File Integrity**: Backup system prevents corruption

### Access Control
- **Email-based Review**: Changes must be approved via email or web interface
- **No Direct Database**: Users cannot directly modify the survey database
- **Audit Trail**: All changes are logged with timestamps

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Email buttons not working:**
- Ensure `/api/survey-api.php` is accessible
- Check PHP error logs
- Verify file permissions

**Changes not applying:**
- Check write permissions on `pages/survey.html`
- Verify JSON files are writable
- Review PHP error logs

**Images not showing:**
- Confirm image paths in email are correct
- Check that images are accessible via web
- Verify base URL in email generation

### File Permissions
```bash
chmod 644 pages/survey.html
chmod 644 api/*.json
chmod 755 api/survey-api.php
```

## üéØ Advanced Configuration

### Email Customization
Edit the `createEnhancedEmailHTML()` function in survey.html to customize:
- Email styling and layout
- Button text and colors
- Image sizes and presentation
- Additional metadata

### API Endpoints
The `/api/survey-api.php` supports these actions:
- `submit_changes`: Process new survey submissions
- `approve_change`: Apply approved changes to survey
- `deny_change`: Permanently reject changes

### Database Structure
Changes are stored in JSON format with these fields:
```json
{
  "changeId": {
    "filename": "image_name",
    "newName": "Proposed name",
    "newDescription": "Proposed description", 
    "submittedAt": "2025-01-15 10:30:00",
    "imagePath": "path/to/image.png"
  }
}
```

This system provides a complete workflow for managing survey changes while maintaining quality control and preventing spam submissions.
