//Good job for finding the totally unsecure login credentials for a websight that has no real value! You must be so proud of yourself!
//This was never meant to be truly secure considering no actual sensitive data is involved. This was just a deterant from people who act dumb. Thank-you for your time and consideration when it came to locating this!
//It really means a lot when someone actually enjoys doing this kind of stuff for fun!
